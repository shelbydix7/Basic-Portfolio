        My name is Shelby Dix, I was born and raised in the great state of Missouri. 
        <br>
        Where I quickly left and never looked back at age 18.
    
        I am heavily involved in a realtionship with Forensic Files (aka the greatest show ever made),
        <br>
    and as well the history of every United States President (It's odd, I'm well aware).
    <br>
    
    
    For a little bit about my music taste, my favorite top three bands are listed below:
    <ol>
        <li>Pink FLoyd</li>
        <li>Led Zepplin</li>
        <li>A$AP Rocky</li>
    </ol>

<div class= "Hawaii" p>I also love to travel as seen to the picture to the left which was taken on a hike on a Hawiian mountain on the island of Kuaui.</p></div>
