<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    My name is Shelby Dix, I was born and raised in the great state of Missouri. 
    <br>
    Where I quickly left and never looked back at age 18.</p>
<p>
    I am heavily involved in a realtionship with Forensic Files (aka the greatest show ever made),
    <br>
and as well the history of every United States President (It's odd, I'm well aware).
</p>

<p> 
For a little bit about my music taste, my favorite top three bands are listed below:
<ol>
   <li>Pink FLoyd</li>
    <li>Led Zepplin</li>
    <li>A$AP Rocky</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
    I also love to travel as seen to the picture to the left which was taken on a hike on a Hawiian mountain on the island of Kuaui.
